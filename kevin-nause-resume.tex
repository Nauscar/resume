\section{About}
{I enjoy low level programming on platforms such as embedded systems and operating systems.
Working on wearable hacks and obtaining root access on mobile devices are also side interests. 
Computer security and logical analysis are key interests of mine. 
I have been a Linux enthusiast since I typed "Hello World" for the first time and have adored penguins ever since. 
The first thing I do when I sit down at a computer is change the keyboard layout to Dvorak and plug in a keyboard that is older than myself: the IBM Model M.}

{Automated Home Brewery System}
{Brew It Yourself}
{The objective of this project is to combine homebrewing experience with engineering design, and construct a single vessel brewing system. By maintaining a strict control of key parameters, the brewing process is regulated using a combination of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, digital controls, power systems, embedded robotics and mobile development.  For more information please see the \href{https://github.com/BrewItYourself/Documentation/blob/master/Final\%20Report/finalreportpdf/final-report.pdf}{Design Overview} on GitHub.}\\

{Myo DSLR Control}
{Thalmic Labs}
{After being accepted into Thalmic Lab's alpha test program, this project focused on creating an interface between the Myo armband and an Arduino to control the shutter of a DSLR via the remote trigger pin-out and an IR sensor.  This concept was than expanded to utilize TCP/IP communications in order to control the camera's shutter at even greater distances and remote locations.}
